# Led_Cube

## Avramidis Dimitris, Georgiou Charidimos
4x4x4 Led_Cube using arduino nano

### Components
* Arduino Nano R3
* 64 3mm LED lights (blue)
* 4x100Î© Resistors
* Female Headers
* Plywood
* PCB Board

### Tools
* Soldering wire
* Soldering iron

### Applications
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

### Making the 4 x 4 template for the layers
* Draw a 4 x 4 grid of 2.5 cm on the plywood.
* Drill holes of 3-3.5mm on each point of interection of the grid
* Test that led lights fit properly as seen on the image below
* Template is ready
* Using the grid make 4 layers of 4 x 4 LED lights, one for each level of our cube soldering the negative poles of the LED, thus short circuiting the negative poles of LED lights for each layer

### Making the cube
* Allign the 4 levels of 4 x 4 layers made as mentioned above and solder the positive poles of each LED that belong on same column thus short circuiting the positive poles of LED lights for each column. Make sure that each layers has a distance of 2.5cm from the previous one, so our construction is a cube
